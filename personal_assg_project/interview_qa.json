    "answer": "To compute the **Euclidean distance** between two series (vectors) in Python, you can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Euclidean Distance} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( x_i \\) and \\( y_i \\) are the corresponding elements in the two series (vectors).\n- \\( n \\) is the number of elements in the series.\n\nHere’s a simple Python code to compute the Euclidean distance between two series:\n\nUsing NumPy:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef euclidean_distance(series1, series2):\n    # Ensure both series have the same length\n    if len(series1) != len(series2):\n        raise ValueError(\"Series must have the same length\")\n    \n    # Compute the Euclidean distance\n    distance = np.sqrt(np.sum((np.array(series1) - np.array(series2)) ** 2))\n    \n    return distance\n\nExample usage\nseries1 = [1, 2, 3]\nseries2 = [4, 5, 6]\n\ndistance = euclidean_distance(series1, series2)\nprint(f'Euclidean Distance: {distance}')\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- Convert the two input series to NumPy arrays: `np.array(series1)` and `np.array(series2)`.\n- Subtract the two arrays element-wise and square the result: `(series1 - series2) ** 2`.\n- Sum the squared differences using `np.sum()`.\n- Take the square root of the result using `np.sqrt()` to get the Euclidean distance.\n\n### Example:\nFor the series:\n- Series 1: \\([1, 2, 3]\\)\n- Series 2: \\([4, 5, 6]\\)\n\nThe Euclidean distance is computed as:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(1-4)^2 + (2-5)^2 + (3-6)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 9 + 9} = \\sqrt{27} \\approx 5.196\n\\]\n\nThis approach is efficient and works well for series or vectors of any size.",

While running an algorithm on any data, to gather proper insights, it is very much necessary to have correct and clean data that contains only relevant information. Dirty data most often results in poor or incorrect insights and predictions which can have damaging effects. For example, while launching any big campaign to market a product, if our data analysis tells us to target a product that in reality has no demand and if the campaign is launched, it is bound to fail. This results in a loss of the company’s revenue. This is where the importance of having proper and clean data comes into the picture.\nData Cleaning of the data coming from different sources helps in data transformation and results in the data where the data scientists can work on. Properly cleaned data increases the accuracy of the model and provides very good predictions. If the dataset is very large, then it becomes cumbersome to run data on it. The data cleanup step takes a lot of time (around 80% of the time) if the data is huge. It cannot be incorporated with running the model. Hence, cleaning data before running the model, results in increased speed and efficiency of the model. Data cleaning helps to identify and fix any structural issues in the data.

    "answer": "While using a dataset in data science or machine learning algorithms, it so happens that not all the variables are necessary and useful to build a model. Smarter feature selection methods are required to avoid redundant models to increase the efficiency of our model. Following are the three main methods in feature selection: Filter Methods: These methods pick up only the intrinsic properties of features that are measured via univariate statistics and not cross-validated performance. They are straightforward and are generally faster and require less computational resources when compared to wrapper methods. There are various filter methods such as the Chi-Square test, Fisher’s Score method, Correlation Coefficient, Variance Threshold, Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) method, Dispersion Ratios, etc.\nWrapper Methods: Data Science Interview Questions These methods need some sort of method to search greedily on all possible feature subsets, access their quality by learning and evaluating a classifier with the feature. The selection technique is built upon the machine learning algorithm on which the given dataset needs to fit. There are three types of wrapper methods, they are: Forward Selection: Here, one feature is tested at a time and new features are added until a good fit is obtained. Backward Selection: Here, all the features are tested and the nonfitting ones are eliminated one by one to see while checking which works better. Recursive Feature Elimination: The features are recursively checked and evaluated how well they perform. These methods are generally computationally intensive and require highend resources for analysis. But these methods usually lead to better predictive models having higher accuracy than filter methods.\nEmbedded Methods: Data Science Interview Questions Embedded methods constitute the advantages of both filter and wrapper methods by including feature interactions while maintaining reasonable computational costs. These methods are iterative as they take each model iteration and carefully extract features contributing to most of the training in that iteration. Examples of embedded methods: LASSO Regularization (L1), Random Forest Importance.",

    "question": "How will you balance/correct imbalanced data?",
    "answer": "There are different techniques to correct/balance imbalanced data. It can be done by increasing the sample numbers for minority classes. The number of samples can be decreased for those classes with extremely high data points. Following are some approaches followed to balance data: \nUse the right evaluation metrics: In cases of imbalanced data, it is very important to use the right evaluation metrics that provide valuable information.\nSpecificity/Precision: Indicates the number of selected instances that are relevant. \nSensitivity: Indicates the number of relevant instances that are selected. \nF1 score: It represents the harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity. \nMCC (Matthews correlation coefficient): It represents the correlation coefficient between observed and predicted binary classifications. \nAUC (Area Under the Curve): This represents a relation between the true positive rates and false-positive rates. \nFor example, consider the below graph that illustrates training data: Here, if we measure the accuracy of the model in terms of getting \"0\"s, then the accuracy of the model would be very high -> 99.9%, but the model does not guarantee any valuable information. In such cases, we can apply different evaluation metrics as stated above.\nTraining Set Resampling: It is also possible to balance data by working on getting different datasets and this can be achieved by resampling. There are two approaches followed under-sampling that is used based on the use case and the requirements: \nUnder-sampling This balances the data by reducing the size of the abundant class and is used when the data quantity is sufficient. By performing this, a new dataset that is balanced can be retrieved and this can be used for further modeling. \nOver-sampling This is used when data quantity is not sufficient. This method balances the dataset by trying to increase the samples size. Instead of getting rid of extra samples, new samples are generated and introduced by employing the methods of repetition, bootstrapping, etc. \nPerform K-fold cross-validation correctly: Cross-Validation needs to be applied properly while using over-sampling. The cross-validation should be done before over-sampling because if it is done later, then it would be like overfitting the model to get a specific result. To avoid this, resampling of data is done repeatedly with different ratios.",

    "answer": "Before citing instances, let us understand what are false positives and false negatives. False Positives are those cases that were wrongly identified as an event even if they were not. They are called Type I errors. False Negatives are those cases that were wrongly identified as non-events despite being an event. They are called Type II errors. Some examples where false positives were important than false negatives are:\nIn the medical field: Consider that a lab report has predicted cancer to a patient even if he did not have cancer. This is an example of a false positive error. It is dangerous to start chemotherapy for that patient as he doesn’t have cancer as starting chemotherapy would lead to damage of healthy cells and might even actually lead to cancer. In the e-commerce field: Suppose a company decides to start a campaign where they give $100 gi vouchers for purchasing $10000 worth of items without any minimum purchase conditions. They assume it would result in at least 20% profit for items sold above $10000. What if the vouchers are given to the customers who haven’t purchased anything but have been mistakenly marked as those who purchased $10000 worth of products. This is the case of falsepositive error. 34. Give one example where both false positives and false negatives are important equally? In Banking fields: Lending loans are the main sources of income to the banks. But if the repayment rate isn’t good, then there is a risk of huge losses instead of any profits. So giving out loans to customers is a gamble as banks can’t risk losing good customers but at the same time, they can’t afford to acquire bad customers. This case is a classic example of equal importance in false positive and false negative scenarios.",

Hyperparameters are those properties that are fixed and model-specific before the model is tested or trained on the dataset. Both the grid search and random search tuning strategies are optimization techniques to find efficient hyperparameters. \nGrid Search: \nHere, every combination of a preset list of hyperparameters is tried out and evaluated. \nThe search pattern is similar to searching in a grid where the values are in a matrix and a search is performed. Each parameter set is tried out and their accuracy is tracked. a er every combination is tried out, the model with the highest accuracy is chosen as the best one. \nThe main drawback here is that, if the number of hyperparameters is increased, the technique suffers. The number of evaluations can increase exponentially with each increase in the hyperparameter. This is called the problem of dimensionality in a grid search.\nRandom Search: \nIn this technique, random combinations of hyperparameters set are tried and evaluated for finding the best solution. For optimizing the search, the function is tested at random configurations in parameter space as shown in the image below. \nIn this method, there are increased chances of finding optimal parameters because the pattern followed is random. There are chances that the model is trained on optimized parameters without the need for aliasing. \nThis search works the best when there is a lower number of dimensions as it takes less time to find the right set.",

The distribution is symmetric around its mean, and the bell curve is centered at the mean. The probabilities for values that are further from the mean taper off equally in both directions. Similar rarity applies to extreme values in the two tails of the distribution. Not all symmetrical distributions are normal, even though the normal distribution is symmetrical.\nThe standard normal distribution, also known as the Z distribution, is a special case of the normal distribution where the mean (μ) is 0 and the standard deviation (σ) is 1.

    "answer": "The k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple and versatile supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. KNN makes predictions by memorizing the data points rather than building a model about it. This is why it is also called “lazy learner” or “memory based” model too.\nKNN relies on the principle that similar data points tend to belong to the same class or have similar target values. This means that, In the training phase, KNN stores the entire dataset consisting of feature vectors and their corresponding class labels (for classification) or target values (for regression). It then calculates the distances between that point and all the points in the training dataset. (commonly used distance metrics are Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance).\n(Note : Choosing an appropriate value for k is crucial. A small k may result in noisy predictions, while a large k can smooth out the decision boundaries. The choice of distance metric and feature scaling also impact KNN’s performance.)",

    "answer": "Decision trees are a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They work by creating a tree-like structure of decisions based on input features to make predictions or decisions. Lets dive into its core concepts and how they work briefly:\nDecision trees consist of nodes and edges.\nThe tree starts with a root node and branches into internal nodes that represent features or attributes.\nThese nodes contain decision rules that split the data into subsets.\nEdges connect nodes and indicate the possible decisions or outcomes.\nLeaf nodes represent the final predictions or decisions.\n \nThe objective is to increase data homogeneity, which is often measured using standards like mean squared error (for regression) or Gini impurity (for classification). Decision trees can handle a variety of attributes and can effectively capture complex data relationships. They can, however, overfit, especially when deep or complex. To reduce overfitting, strategies like pruning and restricting tree depth are applied.",

It plays a crucial role in model selection and understanding the generalization performance of a machine learning algorithm. Here’s an explanation of these concepts:\nBias: Bias is simply described as the model’s inability to forecast the real value due of some difference or inaccuracy. These differences between actual or expected values and the predicted values are known as error or bias error or error due to bias.\nVariance: Variance is a measure of data dispersion from its mean location. In machine learning, variance is the amount by which a predictive model’s performance differs when trained on different subsets of the training data. More specifically, variance is the model’s variability in terms of how sensitive it is to another subset of the training dataset, i.e. how much it can adapt on the new subset of the training dataset.\n\tLow Bias\tHigh Bias\nLow Variance\tBest fit (Ideal Scenario )\tUnderfitting\nHigh Variance\tOverfitting\tNot capture the underlying patterns\n(Worst Case)\nAs a Data Science Professional, Our focus should be to achieve the the best fit model i.e Low Bias and Low Variance. A model with low bias and low variance suggests that it can capture the underlying patterns in the data (low bias) and is not overly sensitive to changes in the training data (low variance). This is the perfect circumstance for a machine learning model, since it can generalize effectively to new, previously unknown data and deliver consistent and accurate predictions. However, in practice, this is not achievable.\n \nIf the algorithm is too simplified (hypothesis with linear equation), it may be subject to high bias and low variance, making it error-prone. If algorithms fit too complicated a hypothesis (hypothesis with a high degree equation), it may have a large variance and a low bias. In the latter case, the new entries will underperform. There is, however, something in between these two situations called as a Trade-off or Bias Variance Trade-off. So, that An algorithm can’t be more complex and less complex at the same time.",

When using this in a classification problem (let’s say a text classification), there could a word which did not appear in the particular class. In those cases, the probability of feature given a class label will be zero. This could create a big problem when getting predictions out of the training data.\nTo overcome this problem, we use Laplace smoothing. Laplace smoothing addresses the zero probability problem by adding a small constant (usually 1) to the count of each feature in each class and to the total count of features in each class. Without smoothing, if any feature is missing in a class, the probability of that class given the features becomes zero, making the classifier overly confident and potentially leading to incorrect classifications",

    "question": "What are imbalanced datasets and how can we handle them?",
    "answer": "Imbalanced datasets are datasets in which the distribution of class labels (or target values) is heavily skewed, meaning that one class has significantly more instances than any other class. Imbalanced datasets pose challenges because models trained on such data can have a bias toward the majority class, leading to poor performance on the minority class, which is often of greater interest. This will lead to the model not generalizing well on the unseen data.\nTo handle imbalanced datasets, we can approach the following methods:\nResampling (Method of either increasing or decreasing the number of samples):\nUp-sampling: In this case, we can increase the classes for minority by either sampling without replacement or generating synthetic examples. Some of the popular examples are SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), etc.\nDown-sampling: Another case would be to randomly cut down the majority class such that it is comparable to minority class.\nEnsemble methods (using models which are capable of handling imbalanced dataset inherently:\nBagging : Techniques like Random Forests, which can mitigate the impact of class imbalance by constructing multiple decision trees from bootstrapped samples\nBoosting: Algorithms like AdaBoost and XGBoost can give more importance to misclassified minority class examples in each iteration, improving their representation in the final model",

    "answer": "When dealing with a dataset that has high dimensionality (high number of features), we are often encountered with various issues and problems. Some of the issues faced while dealing with dimensionality dataset are listed below:\nComputational expense: The biggest problem with handling a dataset with vast number of features is that it takes a long time to process and train the model on it. This can lead to wastage of both time and monetary resources.\nData sparsity: Many times data points are far from each other (high sparsity). This makes it harder to find the underlying patterns between features and can be a hinderance in proper analysis\nVisualising issues and overfitting: It is rather easy to visualize 2d and 3d data. But beyond this order, it is difficult to properly visualize our data. Furthermore, more data features can be correlated and provide misleading information to the model training and cause overfitting.\nThese issues are what are generally termed as “Curse of Dimensionality”.\nTo overcome this, we can follow different approaches – some of which are mentioned below:\nFeature Selection: Many a times, not all the features are necessary. It is the user’s job to select out the features that would be necessary in solving a given problem statement.\nFeature engineering: Sometimes, we may need a feature that is the combination of many other features. This method can, in general, reduces the features count in the dataset.\nDimensionality Reduction techniques: These techniques reduce the number of features in a dataset while preserving as much useful information as possible. Some of the famous Dimensionality reduction techniques are: Principle component analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), etc.\nRegularization: Some regularization techniques like L1 and L2 regularizations are useful when deciding the impact each feature has on the model training.",

The selection of examples is done independently for each iteration. This is capable of faster updates and can handle large datasets because it processes one example at a time but high variance can cause it to converge slower.\nMini-Batch Gradient Descent: Mini-Batch Gradient Descent strikes a balance between BGD and SGD. It divides the training dataset into small, equally-sized subsets called mini-batches. In each iteration, a mini-batch is randomly sampled, and the gradient is computed based on this mini-batch.

    "answer": "In NLP, the concept of word embedding is use to capture semantic and contextual information. Word embeddings are dense representations of words or phrases in continuous-valued vectors in a high-dimensional space. Each word is mapped to a vector with the real numbers, these vectors are learned from large corpora of text data.\nWord embeddings are based on the Distributional Hypothesis, which suggests that words that appear in similar context have similar meanings. This idea is used by word embedding models to generate vector representations that reflect the semantic links between words depending on how frequently they co-occur with other words in the text.\nThe most common word embeddings techniques are-\nBag of Words (BOW)\nWord2Vec\nGlove: Global Vector for word representation\nTerm frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)\nBERT",

    "answer": "A neural network architecture called a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model is made to cope with data sequences, making it particularly helpful for jobs involving variable-length input and output sequences. Machine translation, text summarization, question answering, and other tasks all benefit from its extensive use in natural language processing.\nThe Seq2Seq consists of two main components: encoder and decoder. The encoder takes input sequence and converts into fixed length vector . The vector captures features and context of the sequence. The decoder takes the vector as input and generated output sequence. This autoregressive technique frequently entails influencing the subsequent prediction using the preceding one.",

With reference to a certain variable of interest, it is the likelihood that an event will occur, without taking into account the results of other variables. Basically, it treats the other variables as if they were “marginal” or irrelevant and concentrates on one.\nMarginal probabilities are essential in many statistical analyses, including estimating anticipated values, computing conditional probabilities, and drawing conclusions about certain variables of interest while taking other variables’ influences into account.",

    "question": "How do you deal with a categorical variable which has high cardinality?",
    "answer": "Dealing with high cardinality in categorical variables is a common challenge in data science, as it can lead to increased memory usage and reduced model performance. Here are some effective strategies to handle this:\n\n1. Frequency Encoding: Replace each category with the frequency or count of that category in the dataset. This approach maintains the weight of each category based on its occurrence.\n\n2. Target Encoding: Calculate the mean of the target variable for each category and replace the category value with this mean. This method is particularly useful when there’s a correlation between the categorical feature and the target, but it can lead to overfitting if not properly regularized.\n\n3. Feature Hashing (Hashing Trick): Use a hash function to reduce the number of unique categories by mapping multiple categories to the same bucket. This can significantly reduce the dimensionality but might introduce some collisions where different values get the same hash.\n\n4. Dimensionality Reduction Techniques: Techniques such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) can be adapted for categorical variables through methods like MCA (Multiple Correspondence Analysis) to reduce the number of categorical levels into a smaller set of dimensions.\n\n5. Rare Category Aggregation: Combine categories that appear infrequently into a single ‘Other’ category. This reduces the problem of overfitting that might occur with rare categories.\n\n6. Binary Encoding: Instead of a simple one-hot encoding, binary encoding converts the integers (obtained from categorical values) into binary code, and then splits the bits into separate columns. This reduces the data dimension but keeps more information than one-hot encoding if there are many categories.\n\n7. Use of Domain Knowledge: If applicable, use domain knowledge to merge categories in a meaningful way or to discard irrelevant categories.\n\n8. Embedding Layers: Particularly in neural networks, use embedding layers which can learn an optimal representation of categorical data during the training process.",

    "question": "Explain the central limit theorem and give examples of when you can use it in a real-world problem.",
    "answer": "The central limit theorem states that if any random variable, regardless of the distribution, is sampled a large enough time, the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed. This allows for studying the properties of any statistical distribution as long as there is a large enough sample size.\nWe can rely on the CLT with means (because it applies to any unbiased statistic) only if expressing data in this way makes sense. And it makes sense ONLY in the case of unimodal and symmetric data, coming from additive processes. So forget skewed, multi-modal data with mixtures of distributions, coming from multiplicative processes, and non-trivial mean-variance relationships. That are the places where arithmetic means is meaningless. Thus, using the CLT of e.g. bootstrap will give some valid answers to an invalid question.\nThe distribution of means isn't enough. Every single kind of inference requires the entire test statistic to follow a certain distribution. And the test statistic consists also of the estimate of variance. Never assume the same sample size sufficient for means will suffice for the entire test statistic. See an excerpt from Rand Wilcox attached. Especially do never believe in magic numbers like N=30.\nThink first about how to sensible describe your data, state the hypothesis of interest and then apply a valid method.\nExamples of real-world usage of CLT:\n1.\tThe CLT can be used at any company with a large amount of data. Consider companies like Uber/Lyft wants to test whether adding a new feature will increase the booked rides or not using hypothesis testing. So if we have a large number of individual ride X, which in this case is a Bernoulli random variable (since the rider will book a ride or not), we can estimate the statistical properties of the total number of bookings. Understanding and estimating these statistical properties play a significant role in applying hypothesis testing to your data and knowing whether adding a new feature will increase the number of booked riders or not.\n2.\tManufacturing plants often use the central limit theorem to estimate how many products produced by the plant are defective.\nCourse: Statistics/Probability",

    "question": "Briefly explain the A/B testing and its application? What are some common pitfalls encountered in A/B testing?",
    "answer": "A/B testing helps us to determine whether a change in something will cause a change in performance significantly or not. So in other words you aim to statistically estimate the impact of a given change within your digital product (for example). You measure success and counter metrics on at least 1 treatment vs 1 control group (there can be more than 1 XP group for multivariate tests).\nApplications:\n1.\tConsider the example of a general store that sells bread packets but not butter, for a year. If we want to check whether its sale depends on the butter or not, then suppose the store also sells butter and sales for next year are observed. Now we can determine whether selling butter can significantly increase/decrease or doesn't affect the sale of bread.\n2.\tWhile developing the landing page of a website you create 2 different versions of the page. You define a criteria for success eg. conversion rate. Then define your hypothesis Null hypothesis(H): No difference between the performance of the 2 versions. Alternative hypothesis(H'): version A will perform better than B.\nNOTE: You will have to split your traffic randomly(to avoid sample bias) into 2 versions. The split doesn't have to be symmetric, you just need to set the minimum sample size for each version to avoid undersample bias.\nNow if version A gives better results than version B, we will still have to statistically prove that results derived from our sample represent the entire population. Now one of the very common tests used to do so is 2 sample t-test where we use values of significance level (alpha) and p-value to see which hypothesis is right. If p-value<alpha, H is rejected.\nCommon pitfalls:\n1.\tWrong success metrics inadequate to the business problem\n2.\tLack of counter metric, as you might add friction to the product regardless along with the positive impact\n3.\tSample mismatch: heterogeneous control and treatment, unequal variances\n4.\tUnderpowered test: too small sample or XP running too short 5.

    "question": "Describe briefly the hypothesis testing and p-value in layman’s term? And give a practical application for them ?",
    "answer": "In Layman's terms:\n•\tHypothesis test is where you have a current state (null hypothesis) and an alternative state (alternative hypothesis). You assess the results of both of the states and see some differences. You want to decide whether the difference is due to the alternative approach or not.\nYou use the p-value to decide this, where the p-value is the likelihood of getting the same results the alternative approach achieved if you keep using the existing approach. It's the probability to find the result in the gaussian distribution of the results you may get from the existing approach.\nThe rule of thumb is to reject the null hypothesis if the p-value < 0.05, which means that the probability to get these results from the existing approach is <95%. But this % changes according to task and domain.\nTo explain the hypothesis testing in Layman's term with an example, suppose we have two drugs A and B, and we want to determine whether these two drugs are the same or different. This idea of trying to determine whether the drugs are the same or different is called hypothesis testing. The null hypothesis is that the drugs are the same, and the p-value helps us decide whether we should reject the null hypothesis or not.\np-values are numbers between 0 and 1, and in this particular case, it helps us to quantify how confident we should be to conclude that drug A is different from drug B. The closer the p-value is to 0, the more confident we are that the drugs A and B are different.\nCourse: Statistics/Probability",

    "question": "What is the meaning of selection bias and how to avoid it?",
    "answer": "Sampling bias is the phenomenon that occurs when a research study design fails to collect a representative sample of a target population. This typically occurs because the selection criteria for respondents failed to capture a wide enough sampling frame to represent all viewpoints.\nThe cause of sampling bias almost always owes to one of two conditions.\n1.\tPoor methodology: In most cases, non-representative samples pop up when researchers set improper parameters for survey research. The most accurate and repeatable sampling method is simple random sampling where a large number of respondents are chosen at random. When researchers stray from random sampling (also called probability sampling), they risk injecting their own selection bias into recruiting respondents.\n2.\tPoor execution: Sometimes data researchers craft scientifically sound sampling methods, but their work is undermined when field workers cut corners. By reverting to convenience sampling (where the only people studied are those who are easy to reach) or giving up on reaching non-responders, a field worker can jeopardize the careful methodology set up by data scientists.\nThe best way to avoid sampling bias is to stick to probability-based sampling methods. These include simple random sampling, systematic sampling, cluster sampling, and stratified sampling. In these methodologies, respondents are only chosen through processes of random selection—even if they are sometimes sorted into demographic groups along the way. \nCourse: Statistics/Probability",

    "answer": "KPI stands for key performance indicator, a quantifiable measure of performance over time for a specific objective. KPIs provide targets for teams to shoot for, milestones to gauge progress, and insights that help people across the organization make better decisions. From finance and HR to marketing and sales, key performance indicators help every area of the business move forward at the strategic level.\nKPIs are an important way to ensure your teams are supporting the overall goals of the organization. Here are some of the biggest reasons why you need key performance indicators.\n•\tKeep your teams aligned: Whether measuring project success or employee performance, KPIs keep teams moving in the same direction.\n•\tProvide a health check: Key performance indicators give you a realistic look at the health of your organization, from risk factors to financial indicators.\n•\tMake adjustments: KPIs help you clearly see your successes and failures so you can do more of what’s working, and less of what’s not.\n•\tHold your teams accountable: Make sure everyone provides value with key performance indicators that help employees track their progress and help managers move things along.\nTypes of KPIs Key performance indicators come in many flavors. While some are used to measure monthly progress against a goal, others have a longer-term focus. The one thing all KPIs have in common is that they’re tied to strategic goals. Here’s an overview of some of the most common types of KPIs.\n•\tStrategic: These big-picture key performance indicators monitor organizational goals. Executives typically look to one or two strategic KPIs to find out how the organization is doing at any given time. Examples include return on investment, revenue and market share.\n•\tOperational: These KPIs typically measure performance in a shorter time frame, and are focused on organizational processes and efficiencies. Some examples include sales by region, average monthly transportation costs and cost per acquisition (CPA).\n•\tFunctional Unit: Many key performance indicators are tied to specific functions, such finance or IT. While IT might track time to resolution or average uptime, finance KPIs track gross profit margin or return on assets. These functional KPIs can also be classified as strategic or operational.\n•\tLeading vs Lagging: Regardless of the type of key performance indicator you define, you should know the difference between leading indicators and lagging indicators. While leading KPIs can help predict outcomes, lagging KPIs track what has already happened. Organizations use a mix of both to ensure they’re tracking what’s most important.\n \nCourse: Statistics/Probability",

If the curve is shifted to the left or to the right, it is said to be skewed.Skewness can be quantified as a representation of the extent to which a given distribution varies from a normal distribution. There are two main types of skewness negative skew which refers to a longer or fatter tail on the left side of the distribution, while positive skew refers to a longer or fatter tail on the right. These two skews refer to the direction or weight of the distribution.\nThe mean of positively skewed data will be greater than the median. In a negatively skewed distribution, the exact opposite is the case: the mean of negatively skewed data will be less than the median. If the data graphs symmetrically, the distribution has zero skewness, regardless of how long or fat the tails are.\nThere are several ways to measure skewness. Pearson’s first and second coefficients of skewness are two common methods. Pearson’s first coefficient of skewness, or Pearson mode skewness, subtracts the mode from the mean and divides the difference by the standard deviation. Pearson’s second coefficient of skewness, or Pearson median skewness, subtracts the median from the mean, multiplies the difference by three, and divides the product by the standard deviation.",

It is used to estimate the precision or accuracy of a sample statistic, such as a mean or a proportion, based on a sample from a larger population.\nFor example, if we want to estimate the average height of all adults in a certain region, we can take a random sample of individuals from that region and calculate the sample mean height. Then we can construct a confidence interval for the true population mean height, based on the sample mean and the sample size, with a certain level of confidence, such as 95%. This means that if we repeat the sampling process many times, 95% of the resulting intervals will contain the true population mean height.\nThe formula for a confidence interval is: confidence interval = sample statistic +/- margin of error\nThe margin of error depends on the sample size, the standard deviation of the population (or the sample, if the population standard deviation is unknown), and the desired level of confidence. For example, if the sample size is larger or the standard deviation is smaller, the margin of error will be smaller, resulting in a narrower confidence interval.\nA prediction interval is a range of values that is likely to contain a future observation or outcome with a certain level of confidence. It is used to estimate the uncertainty or variability of a future value based on a statistical model and the observed data.\nFor example, if we have a regression model that predicts the sales of a product based on its price and advertising budget, we can use a prediction interval to estimate the range of possible sales for a new product with a certain price and advertising budget, with a certain level of confidence, such as 95%. This means that if we repeat the prediction process many times, 95% of the resulting intervals will contain the true sales value.\nThe formula for a prediction interval is: prediction interval = point estimate +/- margin of error\nThe point estimate is the predicted value of the outcome variable based on the model and the input variables. The margin of error depends on the residual standard deviation of the model, which measures the variability of the observed data around the predicted values, and the desired level of confidence. For example, if the residual standard deviation is larger or the level of confidence is higher, the margin of error will be larger, resulting in a wider prediction interval.",

    "question": "Describe the advantages and disadvantages of relational database vs NoSQL databases. Course: SQL",
    "answer": "Advantages of Relational Databases: Ensure data integrity through a defined schema and ACID properties. Easy to get started with and use for small-scale applications. Lends itself well to vertical scaling. Uses an almost standard query language, making learning or switching between types of relational databases easy.\nAdvantages of NoSQL Databases: Offers more flexibility in data format and representations, which makes working with Unstructured or semistructured data easier. Hence, useful when still the data schema or adding new features/functionality rapidly like in a startup environment to scale with horizontal scaling. Lends itself better to applications that need to be highly available.\nDisadvantages of Relational Databases: Data schema needs to be known in advance. Ale schemas is possible, but frequent changes to the schema for large tables can cause performance issues. Horizontal scaling is relatively difficult, leading to eventual performance bottlenecks\nDisadvantages of NoSQL Databases: As outlined by the BASE framework, weaker guarantees of data correctness are made due to the soft-state and eventual consistency property. Managing consistency can also be difficult due to the lack of a predefined schema that's strictly adhered to. Depending on the type of NoSQL database, it can be challenging for the database to handle its types of complex queries or access patterns.",

    "question": "What do you understand by Self Join? Explain using an example. Course: SQL",
    "answer": "Self-join is as its name implies, joining a table to itself on a database, this process may come in handy in a number of cases, such as:\n1- comparing the table's rows to themselves:\nIt's like we have two copies of the same table and join them together on a given condition to reach the required output query.\nEx. If we have a store database with a client's data table holding a bunch of demographics, we could self-join the client's table to get clients who are located in the same city/made a purchase on the same day/etc.\n2- querying a table that has hierarchical data:\nMeaning, the table has a primary key that has a one-to-many relationship with another foreign key inside the same table, in other words, the table has data that refers to the same table. We could use self-join in order to have a clear look at the data by matching its keys.\nEx. The organizational structure of a company may contain an employee table that has an employee id and his manager id (who is also an employee, hence has an employee id too) in the same table. Using self-join on this table would allow us to reference every employee directly to his manager.\nP.S. we would need to take care of duplicates that may occur and consider them in the conditions.",

    "answer": "𝗧𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲𝘀 and 𝗖𝗧𝗘s are both used to store intermediate results in MySQL, but there are some key differences between the two:\n𝗗𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: A temporary table is a physical table that is created in the database and persists until it is explicitly dropped or the session ends. A CTE is a virtual table that is defined only within the scope of a single SQL statement.\n𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲: Temporary tables are stored in the database and occupy physical disk space. CTEs are not stored on disk and exist only in memory for the duration of the query.\n𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀: Temporary tables can be accessed from any session that has the appropriate privileges. CTEs are only accessible within the scope of the query in which they are defined.\n𝗟𝗶𝗳𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗮𝗻: Temporary tables persist until they are explicitly dropped or the session ends. CTEs are only available for the duration of the query in which they are defined and are then discarded.\n𝗦𝘆𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘅: Temporary tables are created using the CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE statement, while CTEs are defined using the WITH clause.\n𝗣𝘂𝗿𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲: Temporary tables are typically used to store intermediate results that will be used in multiple queries, while CTEs are used to simplify complex queries by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.\nIn summary, temporary tables are physical tables that persist in the database and can be accessed from any session, while CTEs are virtual tables that exist only within the scope of a single query and are discarded once the query is complete. Both temporary tables and CTEs can be useful tools for simplifying complex queries and storing intermediate results.",

    "question": "Why use Right Join When Left Join can suffice the requirement? Course: SQL",
    "answer": "In MySQL, the 𝗥𝗜𝗚𝗛𝗧 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗟𝗘𝗙𝗧 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡 are used to retrieve data from multiple tables by joining them based on a specified condition.\nGenerally, the 𝗟𝗘𝗙𝗧 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡 is used more frequently than the 𝗥𝗜𝗚𝗛𝗧 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡 because it returns all the rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table, or NULL values if there is no match.\nIn most cases, a 𝗟𝗘𝗙𝗧 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡 is sufficient to meet the requirement of retrieving all the data from the left table and matching data from the right table.\nHowever, there may be situations where using a 𝗥𝗜𝗚𝗛𝗧 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡 is more appropriate.\nHere are a few examples:\n𝟭. 𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲: If the right table contains the primary data that needs to be retrieved, and the left table contains supplementary data, a 𝗥𝗜𝗚𝗛𝗧 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡 can be used to retrieve all the data from the right table and matching data from the left table.\n𝟮. 𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗱: In some cases, a 𝗥𝗜𝗚𝗛𝗧 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡 may be more efficient than a 𝗟𝗘𝗙𝗧 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡 because the database optimizer can choose the most efficient join order based on the query structure and the available indexes.\n𝟯. 𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗷𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘀: If the query requires an outer join, a 𝗥𝗜𝗚𝗛𝗧 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡 may be used to return all the rows from the right table, including those with no matching rows in the left table. It's important to note that while a 𝗥𝗜𝗚𝗛𝗧 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡 can provide additional functionality in certain cases, it may also make the query more complex and difficult to read. In most cases, a 𝗟𝗘𝗙𝗧 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡 is the preferred method for joining tables in MySQL.",

    "question": "Why Rank skips sequence? Course: SQL",
    "answer": "In MySQL, the rank function may skip a sequence of numbers when using the DENSE_RANK() function or the RANK() function, depending on the data and the query. The DENSE_RANK() function assigns a unique rank to each distinct value in a result set, whereas the RANK() function assigns the same rank to the duplicate values.\nHere are some of the reasons why the rank function may skip a sequence in MySQL:\n𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗘𝗡𝗦𝗘_𝗥𝗔𝗡𝗞() function skips ranks when there are ties. For example, if there are two rows with the same values in the ranking column, both will be assigned the same rank, and the next rank will be incremented by 1.\n𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗥𝗔𝗡𝗞() function skips ranks when there are gaps between the duplicate values. For example, if there are three rows with the same values in the ranking column, and then the next row has a higher value, the RANK() function will skip over the fourth rank.\nThe query may have filtering or grouping clauses that affect the ranking. For example, if a query filters out some rows or groups them by a different column, the ranking may not be sequential.\nIt's important to note that the ranking function in MySQL behaves differently from the ranking function in other databases, so the same query may produce different results in different database systems.",
